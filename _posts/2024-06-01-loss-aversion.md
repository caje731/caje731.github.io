Last weekend I learnt of [Daniel Kahneman][wiki]'s demise. Having consumed some of his popular works and some inspired spin-offs, the news saddened me - I felt like I lost a mentor, even though I never knew the man. I spent a bit of time reflecting on his loss-aversion lessons. One of them was the "inability to close doors".

My most expensive IKEA purchase, a double-door white wardrobe, has now run out of space for my clothes. Many are trousers in multiple waist-sizes - a reflection of my struggle to keep physically fit over the years. On most days now, the same few pairs of the widest trousers get worn; the others a fallback on the off chance I drop a few sizes. I know I won't need more than one size at a time, but I'm unable to part with the unused pairs. If I really wanted to get fitter, I would recycle a few of my widest pairs and invest in a good pair of running shoes. So why am I still hoarding sizes 30 to 36 in beige, black, and blue?

I knew a software developer who kept removing dead and obsolete lines code by commenting them out (not deleting them). When asked why they weren't using the version-control software for availability and recall, their response was the quintessential "This way I can easily un-comment it and begin using it again in the future." A little more probing, and it seemed they suffered from the inability to close doors - same as I did with my trousers.

The phrase *to close doors* comes from some well demonstrated [loss aversion experiments][mit] in the early 2000s by professors of psychology Dan Ariely and Jiwoong Shin. This instinct is so strong, it is exhibited everywhere - corporate spheres and business strategies, sales-folk and customers, teams and product choices. Why we do this isn't immediately obvious - perhaps because its toll isn't obvious either. The scientists learnt something about human behavior - it isn't so much about keeping our future flexible as much as it is about avoiding the pain of watching our options diminish. Classic loss aversion.

In the controlled behavioral experiments, the loss was quantifiable in terms of cash lost. In the real world, it is always easy to keep options open, because the costs are less apparent - squandered time or energy, and missed opportunities. Intangible. Non-obvious. But losses, nevertheless.

Smart teams know this - when building a great product, the product strategy will also often answer what not to engage in. Business strategies can also benefit with a not-to-pursue list - an idea Uber's CEO may probably subscribe to, as he welcomed an inflection point last year in the company's loss-making history with a likely similar tactic.
