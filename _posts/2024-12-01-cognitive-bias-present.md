There are so many gems in The Simpsons.

But in the MoneyBART episode Homer justifies shirking his responsibilities, saying *"That's a problem for future Homer. Man I don't envy that guy!"*.

That's hit too close to home, too many times.

Present Bias is real - brain-wave 🧠 studies have shown that thinking about our future selves is akin to thinking about someone else entirely - we just don't care enough! That may put evolution on the side of chronic procrastinators 🐼 but the question to be asking yourself is:
{: .text-justify}

Every time you cut corners 🐒   
Every time you avoid a difficult conversation 👁️‍🗨️   
Every time you compromise on RnR 🏖   
Every time you delay paying back debt 🤕   

 ... are you respecting your future self enough?

There's no magic mantra to overcome Present Bias for a fulfilling professional life, but here's the necessary rub:

Don't half-ass your work. You'll make a full ass of yourself soon.  
Lean in to the emotions you're running from. They enter your life in exactly the way you avoid them.  
Take down-times, so that your up-times can stay up.  
House-keep adequately, so you can continue to keep your house.
