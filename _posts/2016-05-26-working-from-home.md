A personal experience.

I’ve always wanted to see if there’d be a whole lot to gain if I never had to actually commute to office, not have anyone interrupt me at my desk while I work, and always be able to play my guitar when I felt woozy from too much work.

I’m a programmer. I just need a laptop and a good internet connection to be productive, collaborate with my team, and do some research. I’m grateful to my current employer for recognizing this fact, and for liberating me from the nightmares of commuting to work in Mumbai; they permitted me to work from home.

It’s been almost a year. Good time to take a step back and look at how it turned out for me.

If you stay in Mumbai, there’s a good chance you commute by train. One of my friends recently clicked this picture from a suburban train station:

Now this is a reality for a majority of Mumbaikars. You can’t call it commuting any more — people actually die every day, trying to get to work. Imagine starting your work-day after being jostled around in crowds like this.

Commuting by road isn’t all that different. The Mumbai traffic can frustrate you to no end. You can get stuck in traffic and watch a full Bollywood movie. I once spent nearly 4 hours getting home from work — I used to board one of the state-run buses, get off near a train station, catch a train, and then take a rickshaw home. It was one of the worst days of my life — the bus broke down, the trains were delayed, and it was raining cats and dogs. During that phase of life, I spent 2–3 hours commuting each day, on an average. And that’s a one-way number.

Think about it. If you spend 4 hours a day doing nothing but commuting, and you have a 5-day work week, you commute for roughly 20 hours a week, 80 hours a month, and **960 hours** a year. That’s a crap deal if you ask me. Biblical characters may have had some life-years to spare. I don’t. I’m not ready to waste any of it getting from A to B.

Now imagine if you’d get every one of those thousand hours of your year to do exactly what you want to. Wouldn’t life become instantly wonderful?

My neighbours’ reactions
========================

I’ve had many folks asking me why they see me at home so often, and why I don’t go to work anymore. When I tell them that I don’t need to go to office, and that I work from home, the next thing they ask me is if I do one of those part-time data-entry jobs. And it’s tough to convince them that I don’t — *“But you said you work alone on a computer, no?”*

Working from home almost has a negative connotation where I live. People look at me with suspicion, like I’m lying about something to them. Maybe they think I’m really out of a job, and I’m just saving face by saying I work from home. Occasionally I get that jealous stare too. I take it in my stride.

Home environment
================

This is one of the more challenging parts of this experience.

I live with my parents, in a small apartment. It’s too small for me to carve out a space exclusively for work. Instead, I seat myself in the living room/on the couch/on the bean-bag. So I’m automatically a spectator to whatever goes on at home — somebody visiting us, a neighbour shouting at her kids, my parents turning up the TV volume, the sort. And it’s very, very distracting. I take my code seriously — I’m not some god-gifted coder and I need to put all of my thinking powers to use when I’m coding. And I get frustrated when I can’t do that.

My home is my office.

But for my parents, home is home — a place to relax, goof around if they wish, watch Suryavansham on TV as loudly as they want, turn on the radio to listen to Kishor Kumar, talk animatedly on phone with my uncles/aunts, and just do about anything you’d do at home. And that’s where the conflict lies — I can’t tell my parents to shut up, morality and respect aside, because to them, this is home. They should be able to do anything they wish, without a smart-ass like me telling them otherwise. It’s my problem that I need silence and zero distractions, not theirs.

In this regard, I’m so grateful to my parents. They make so many adjustments and compromises so that I can work peacefully. They watch TV on mute when I’m on call with my boss. They don’t speak on phone in the same room as I’m working in — mom usually moves into the kitchen to take her sister’s calls. Dad speaks softly with visitors at the door so that voices don’t carry over to me. Food is always ready for me whenever I’m hungry, mom takes care of that. I enjoy every comfort that a loving parent would give their child.

But I can’t stay at home and behave like a guest. It’s my home too, and I can’t see my poor mum tiring with household chores, day after day. We don’t have a maid because our experiences with them haven’t been that great. So I chip in — sweeping and swabbing the house, washing utensils and clothes, etc. I do it all when I can. But the point is, I do this almost every other day and it takes a good chunk out of my productive morning. When I finally finish up and settle down with my laptop, half my day’s gone. And I can’t get lost time back. It usually means spending very late nights, trying to finish pending work. And lesser sleep.

Loneliness
==========

This deserves special mention, because it’s as real a problem as any, only more serious.

When you suddenly get cut off from the rest of the world — the regular faces you see in your everyday commute, the colleagues you greet every morning, the office friends who hang around your desk and those you share your lunch with, your close buddies you enjoy gossiping with — take all those away, and you feel like that last pea in your mum’s pea-pulao.

Everytime I ask my friends to meet up, they don’t/can’t because of their own commitments/priorities, and then I feel like a beggar, begging for their time. It’s depressing and hurtful to me, to not get to see and talk to people I care about.

Keeping in touch takes a good deal of real, conscious effort. From both sides.

Loneliness during the first few months drove me into a depressed state of mind. It still does. It’s like a beast that keeps rearing it’s ugly head. I don’t know how to get rid of it.
Doing what I like, when I like

You know that feeling when you’re at office and you wish you could be elsewhere? Well, I don’t, simply because I’m free to do anything, be anywhere, and act anyhow I wish. Of course, that’s assuming that I complete my work on time.

A year ago, like everybody else, I used to wake up early for office. Now I wake up early for a jog. And during my jog I watch others rush to catch their regular trains or buses.

Some afternoons I play badminton with a school buddy, and go swimming.

Some rare days I go meet friends for lunch/dinner. I don’t have to ask permission to “leave office early”. I don’t have to worry about “reaching office late”.

I work at hours when I feel most comfortable working. And that changes from day to day. I don’t have to adhere to a 10–6 schedule.

I play the guitar more frequently than I did before. I’ve bettered my acoustic fingerstyle. I’ve composed 2 fingerstyle songs on my guitar. And I pick up my guitar anytime during the day, sometimes even 20 minutes into work.

I go visit the chapel sometimes in the evening. It was impossible to do this when I had to commute to office.

I occasionally go for a walk in the evening, taking in the beautiful view Naigaon offers. And I remember how my colleagues used to tease me for belonging to “a village”. And then I suck in a mouthful of air and I realise how lucky I am to belong to a village and not to the city proper.

I spend some evenings learning new technology that I think would be a useful addition to the current stack I employ at work. Or brushing up on some algorithm. Or solving a problem/training on HackerEarth. I can invest time now in useful activity — things that can add value to my company or upgrade my own skills.

I began moonlighting on www.helpinghands.gives, a charity-based crowdfunding platform that helps people in their medical emergencies or basic education needs, without taking any cuts or commissions. I haven’t advertised this a lot, because, by my own standards, I’ve done a poor job on it and the design sucks. I’ve literally mashed together some code. But so far the platform has helped 8–9 families, and raised appr. INR 4 lakh for them. I feel good about its utility, and the fact that it was me who created it. I could do it because I was home, not stuck in some annoying traffic jam.

Indiscipline
============

But not having any constraints or a fixed schedule is dangerous.

Some days, my work-day would start at 5 in the morning. Some days I didn’t sleep all night. On some other days, I started work at 7 in the evening.

At one point, my work habits had become so irregular, that it started affecting my health. I had baggy eyes most of the time, felt exhausted without doing a lot of physical activity, and procrastinated whenever I could afford to.

I had to set multiple reminder-alerts on my phone, and plaster my laptop with sticky notes to motivate myself to abide by a schedule.

Spiralling down into a burnout is very easy if you have a heavy workload but not a good schedule. I have been close to that feeling. Thankfully, the second half of the year was much more organised, and much more productive.
Resource Consumption

It’s so easy to take for granted the facilities that your office provides. At home, I can feel the pinch.

I spend 2000 bucks a month on high-speed internet service. This is an absolute necessity for me — I just can’t work without a highly available, very fast internet service. I don’t want my SSH connections to my cloud VMs hanging during an important release.

The electricity bill has increased two-fold ever since I started working from home.

I’ve had to buy a good bean-bag to give me comfort in my day-long coding streaks. If I had a separate room for work, I’d have probably invested in a good desk and a nice ergonomic chair. Those don’t come very cheap.
Overall

I’ve seen first-hand how tough time-management can be. And I’ve managed to tame it to a satisfying extent. And gained good experience and habits in the process.

I’ve become happier than before, because I was able to put my time and energy into things that mattered to me.

I was able to grow as a human being, and as a professional.

I can safely and confidently say that the past year has been one of my most productive and positive years of my career so far. And I can attribute it to the fact that I was able to work from home.
