*This was originally [published on LinkedIn][li]*

I recently led a [Johari Window][wiki] workshop for one of my teams at Volvo Cars.


The Johari Window model enhances emotional intelligence, empathy, and self-awareness in three ways:
* Building trust through self-disclosure.
* Enhancing self-awareness by comparing how others perceive you versus how you see yourself.
* Improving communication and relationships through vulnerability.

The Johari Window is a simple four quadrant system and an ideal window would have a very large open area relative to the others. Of the two ways I know that build trust (consistency in speech and behavior, and comfort in sharing vulnerability) this model is successful in trust-building because it asks individuals to open themselves up to being, and to feel comfortable in being, vulnerable in the company of their team members.

My biggest critique of this model is it works well when teams are open and honest with each other and with themselves, but it fails miserably with others - people new to this often just skim the surface, heaping praise and positivity on to others, defeating the purpose of the exercise. Facilitating a truly authentic Johari Window exercise also requires a great deal of sensitivity, ensuring no one feels pressured, and that feedback is exchanged constructively and sensibly. Also, just like with everything else, mileage varies with the individuals participating. I've heard another critique along the lines of oversimplification of human behavior in 4 quadrants, but I don't see how that affects pragmatic deployment of the model on the ground.

What I love about it is that the exercise can benefit everyone, not just individuals on a one-one basis, but also entire teams, helping us understand our colleagues better and to use that information to improve workplace relationships, communication, and collaboration.

For teams and managers wanting to try this out, here are some tips for reflection on different areas:

Open:
----

* What strengths do you believe the team recognizes?
* What contributions do you make that are acknowledged?
* How do you prefer to communicate with the team?

Blind:
-----

* What behaviors might I be unaware of?
* Can you offer feedback on areas where I could improve?
* Do any of my habits affect the team’s dynamics?

Hidden:
------

* What skills or talents haven’t I shared with the team?
* Are there personal values or experiences influencing my work that the team doesn’t know about?
* What aspects of my working style haven’t I communicated?

Unknown:
-------

* What new challenges or roles would help uncover hidden potential?
* Are there areas for growth I’m curious about but haven’t pursued?
* How can the team support my discovery of new skills?
